The FourDigitLEDdriver, TritoMeros & TetartoMeros files are the topmodules for
the second, third and fourth parts respectively. The corresponding tests are
for checking the corresponding parts. The other modules are for the rest
units that appear with the same names in the report and dataflow.
In addition, there are a few tests that I had made to check it out
operation of some of these sub-units.
